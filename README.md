#### About Speed Dating Experiment dataset
 
Data was gathered from participants in experimental speed dating events from 2002-2004. During the events, the attendees would have a four minute "first date" with every other participant of the opposite sex. At the end of their four minutes, participants were asked if they would like to see their date again. They were also asked to rate their date on six attributes: Attractiveness, Sincerity, Intelligence, Fun, Ambition, and Shared Interests.

The dataset also includes questionnaire data gathered from participants at different points in the process. These fields include: demographics, dating habits, self-perception across key attributes, beliefs on what others find valuable in a mate, and lifestyle information. See the Speed Dating Data Key document below for details.

#### Data Exploration Ideas

* What are the least desirable attributes in a male partner? Does this differ for female partners?
* How important do people think attractiveness is in potential mate selection vs. its real impact?
* Are shared interests more important than a shared racial background?
* Can people accurately predict their own perceived value in the dating market?
* In terms of getting a second date, is it better to be someone's first speed date of the night or their last?

#### About Stanford Dogs Dataset 

The Stanford Dogs dataset contains images of 120 breeds of dogs from around the world. This dataset has been built using images and annotation from ImageNet for the task of fine-grained image categorization. It was originally collected for fine-grain image categorization, a challenging problem as certain dog breeds have near identical features or differ in colour and age.
